              No, the software or services provided by the Bonfire team will never include any type of advertisement or spy on users. If third party developers try to include any ads, Bonfire users will always have the freedom to use an alternative extension or fork it. Similarly, if a user or instance were used to post sponsored content, you could simply block them (we may also implement shared blocklists in future to help with this).

                <li>The Bonfire ecosystem is made up of people and projects cooperating to build interoperable and extensible apps, that can easily plug and play with each other.
                <li>Bonfire apps are open source and modular, meaning they’re made of building blocks you can use to create your own custom apps or extensions. Customise the design, the code, or any aspect, and contribute your improvements to the community.
                <li>There will be diverse apps & extensions to choose from. Do you need a basic social app? A collaborative federated blog? A decentralised forum for group discussion? A space for sharing and curating links and files? An offers and needs map and bulletin board for mutual aid? The community is developing unique approaches for these and more.
                <li>Extensions that have reach an alpha stage include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Bonfire:Me</b></li>
                        <li><b>Bonfire:Social</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Extensions in development:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Conversation</b>: for threaded discussions and direct messaging, which includes threads (with multiple levels of replied), private and group messaging, forking a thread into a new discussion, following a thread to receive all replies, etc.</li>
                        <li><b>Mutual Aid</b>: for users to post and search for requests and offers across different instances according to topic and/or geographical location. Based on the ValueFlows vocabulary. Especially suited for crisis response situations, but also meant for day-to-day life.</li>
                        <li><b>Coordination</b>: create / publish (like a request for help) / prioritise / self-assign tasks. Based on the ValueFlows vocabulary, and will participate in the ForgeFed effort to federate the collaboration around software projects.</li>
                        <li><b>Federated topics</b>: can consist of a hashtag, a category in a taxonomy, a location, etc. This enables users to find a topic they are interested in, see everything that was tagged with that (publicly or in their network), and follow it to receive any new tagged content. This will be interoperable with existing fediverse apps like Mastodon without requiring extra development on their end, and will create a decentralised graph of topics that can help relevant information flow from instance to instance.</li>
                        <li><b>Search</b>: All content on a Bonfire instance (including remote content coming in via follows or federated topics) will also be aggregated in a local search index with which the user can search their own data, information from people or groups they follow, as well as content from topics or locations they are interested in from around the fediverse. This search will happen locally on their device (which is a plus for privacy), with results appearing instantly while typing a query, and being able to filter the results (e.g., by object or activity type, hashtags, topics, or language).</li>

                <li><b>Infrastructure</b>: Bonfire instances are independently set up by technical users (though we are working to simplify that more and more), for themselves and their friends to use. They can be hosted on a connected device (like a server or even a Rasperry Pi) or on a cloud service. The Bonfire team (and possibly others) may also offer hosted services in the future (like a fediverse nomadic identity and syncing service, or encrypted backup storage, rather than full-blown hosting of Bonfire apps).</li>
                <li><b>Functionality</b>: Instance admins can choose which extensions and flavours to include, and users can also tailor their experience according to their needs. Anyone can suggest or request features or changes, though getting something done depends on individual team members or contributors to voluntarily take it on.</li>
                <li><b>Governance</b>: Bonfire instances form one part of a huge network, collectively called the Fediverse. It is made up of many instances - servers with different orientations, purposes and policies, each one running a specific federated application. Each instance admin chooses what app(s), extensions, and configuration, as well as their instance’s rules (usually in the form of a code of conduct), who can join or remain a user, what instances/groups/users they don’t wish to federate with, what device or cloud service they use, etc. Because instance admins are so powerful, our goal with Bonfire is to give regular users the same choices as much as technically possible, and to enable them to set up their own instances as easily as possible.</li>
                <li><b>Moderation</b>: Each instance is moderated by different people, resulting in diverse rules, themes and ambiance. Thus one given instance can suit you better than another, depending on your values, needs and interests.</li>
                <li><b>Economic</b>: Because the Bonfire and the wider fediverse is backed by volunteers, and not investors, it is more resilient. Even if one instance happens to go down, the rest of the network will continue to work uninterrupted. If an app or extension stops being maintained, someone else can pick it up. While there’s no need to “get a return on investment”, we think the fediverse can still improve in resilience, for example by having shared and/or nomadic user identities to avoid being tied to instances that may shut down, and by exploring different models for sustainability of the network and it’s contributors and participants.</li>

                    <li>A federated social network is a system that is decentralised, developed and operated by distinct providers (something like email but for social networks).
